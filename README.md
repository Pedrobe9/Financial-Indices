# Financial-Indices
A hub of financial indices that could be sold to hedge funds for passive income.

## Description

The project was initially envisioned to create a hub page of financial indices that could be sold to hedge funds for passive income. Due to time constraints, the scope was slashed to a single index as a proof of concept.

The stablecoin index is important as it illustrates the paradigm shift from speculative asset to mainstream adoption as a digital currency. It is relevant as more countries, like the Central African Republic are dipping their toes into digital currencies as a last ditch stand of failed monetary policy.

The deployed application can be found at:

## Usage

The header displays the stablecoin index, representing the 24hr trading volume of stablecoin vs the total volume.

To see further information about a particular cryptocurrency, start typing its name into the search box and an autocomplete list of suggestions will appear.

Once the correct cryptocurrency is chosen, the following information will be displayed:
- a graph showing the change in price over the last seven days
- a table displaying current price information
- the methodology for calculating the stablecoin index
- a list of up to five New York Times articles about the cryptocurrency

Here is a gif showing the functionality of the deployed application:
